## Hey everyone !!

## This is a Voting System that facilitates you to
      ~ Add number of candidates (max 6).
      ~ Add their respective names
      ~ Add their respective pictures
      ~ A default voting button for NOTA (ofcourse we must have all kind of opinions including this)

## You can :
      ~ Add results to file named FResults.txt along with date and time
      ~ Display Votes
      ~ Reset Votes
      ~ Clear Votes History
      ~ Lock Menus (which will be locked by default)
      ~ Reset Password (yeah, it's really secure that you need password even to close the application)      

## This is a Secure System where you need password to:
      ~ Unlock the Menus and Tools ( because you won't want voters to reset or clear the result file. Secure Right!!)
      ~ Delete, Reset or Add current Votes to File.
      ~ Reset Password
      ~ And even to close the Application.

## Note if you want the default password...  you will get it in the "Pass.txt" file.
